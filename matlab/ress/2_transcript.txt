Once upon a time, there was a little girl that was loved by everyone who saw her, but especially by her grandmother. One day, the grandmother gave the child a little hooded cape made of red velvet, and because the little girl looked so nice in it and didn't want to wear anything else, she was only called 'Little Red Riding Hood'.
